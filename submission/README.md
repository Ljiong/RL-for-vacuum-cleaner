# README 
Dear reader,

Welcome to our school cleaner agent testing stage! Please run the **Headless.ipynb** jupyter notebook to reproduce the experimental figure in our report. We intentionally set **smaller episode number** to make readers can plot and reproduce the results in a short time, so the performance of algorithms will suffer a loss because of that. The results figure is saved in the current directory with name **test_results.png**. 

We provided envoriment files in Windows and MACOS (sorry for Linux users!), please follow the instruction in **Headless.ipynb ** to use the correct version to run the test. 

The unity interaction interface will pop up when you run the test, which uses the **port 5004**. Please follow the instructions in **Headless.ipynb** if you would like to change it.

Have fun!

Best regards,

Group 6
