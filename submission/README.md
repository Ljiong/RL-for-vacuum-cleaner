Dear reader,

Welcome to our school cleaner agent testing stage! For running our project successully, we will kindly ask you to install the package with the correct version in the requirement.txt, and our python version is 3.9.12. Thanks! Please run the **Headless.ipynb** jupyter notebook to reproduce the experimental figure in our report. We intentionally set **smaller episode number** to make readers can plot and reproduce the results in a short time, so the performance of algorithms will suffer a loss because of that. The results figure is saved in the current directory with name **test_results.png**. 

We provided envoriment files in Windows and MACOS (sorry for Linux users!), please follow the instruction in **Headless.ipynb** to use the correct version to run the test. Our experiment computer is .....补充！

The unity interaction interface will pop up when you run the test, which uses the **port 5004**. Please follow the instructions in **Headless.ipynb** if you would like to change it.

Have fun!

Best regards,

Group 6
